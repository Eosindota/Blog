**Trainer Self Promotion**  
Here are some ideas to get started with promoting your coaching via social media and similar marketing techniques. Remember to reach out to us if you  
have questions or need help!

**Youtube**

- Create educational videos to get your profile promoted by GT. Just let us know and we'll post about it!  
</br>

**Twitter**

- **Pinned Tweet
Example:** ![](https://i.imgur.com/iWmJZjf.png)  
</br>
- Regular Tweets
Example: "Coaching has been great so far, hoping to continue developing coaching as a whole and take on more students!" <br> https://www.gamertrainer.co/trainers/Eosin

**Twitch**  

- Mention that you are coaching when you are streaming!
- You can add custom GamerTrainer graphics and a link to your profile.  
- Configure chatbot mod to mention coaching (i.e. moobot)
- Stream your lessons if possible, it helps others research what you're capable of before booking  
 (ask student for permission first)
- Shoutout that you are coaching if you are given the opportunity! (i.e interviews)


**Lesson Preparation**  
</br>
Prior to the lesson we recommend taking a few steps to prep for your students

- Get in contact with the student
- Ask about history with the game/what they play
- Ask what they're looking to learn
- Determine method of instruction (playing together, over-the-shoulder instruction, gameplay review, etc.)
</br>

Before the lesson starts set up all the tools you will need

- Have the game open if you're entering a spectating mode
- If you are streaming, make sure to you're ready to broadcast when the lesson starts (spread the word that you're  
streaming everywhere too!)
- Connect with student in-game (join same lobby, queue up, etc.) if needed
- Remember, students are at lower skill levels, so practice patience. They're playing the game to have fun, so make sure the  
 lesson is an enjoyable experience!



**Lesson Follow up**
</br>

- Make sure to convey your ending thoughts and leave your student with something like "If you have any questions, feel  
free to message me on Discord"  
- Recommend follow-up lessons, with topics that you could possibly cover, and offer discount code for another
